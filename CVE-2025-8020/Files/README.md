# SSRF Bypass CTF Challenge

This CTF challenge demonstrates a real-world vulnerability in the `private-ip` npm package, where multicast IP addresses (224.0.0.0/4) are not properly identified as private/restricted addresses.

## Challenge Overview

Participants must exploit an SSRF vulnerability in a web application that uses the `private-ip` package for URL validation. The goal is to bypass the IP filtering to access an internal service and retrieve the flag.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Package**: private-ip (all versions up to 3.0.2)
- **Issue**: Missing multicast IP range (224.0.0.0/4) in private IP validation
- **Impact**: SSRF bypass allowing access to internal services
- **CVE**: Based on research by Liran Tal

## How to Play

1. Visit the main challenge page
2. Analyze the URL fetcher service
3. Identify the vulnerability in IP validation
4. Craft a payload using multicast IP addresses
5. Retrieve the flag from the internal service

## Solution

The exploit involves using a multicast IP address that bypasses the `private-ip` validation:

\`\`\`
URL: http://239.255.255.250:8080/flag
\`\`\`

This works because:
- `239.255.255.250` is in the multicast range (224.0.0.0/4)
- The `private-ip` package doesn't include this range in its validation
- The application allows the request, thinking it's an external URL
- The internal service responds with the flag

## Educational Value

This challenge teaches:
- SSRF vulnerability identification and exploitation
- The importance of comprehensive input validation
- Real-world npm package vulnerabilities
- Multicast IP address concepts
- Secure coding practices
